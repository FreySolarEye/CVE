Description
Razer 7.1 SURROUND SOUND Application with version 1.1.85 suffers from a DLL Hijacking Vulnerability. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability to use malicious Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) to gain privilege escalation on the client Windows system. The installer loads the DLL and runs the malicious code that could grant administrative privileges to the attacker.

Steps to Reproduce
Open procmon and apply the aforementioned filters :
ProcessName is = rzappengine.exe
Result is = NAME NOT FOUND
Path ends with = .dll

Opening up the application and taking a deeper look you’ll spot that the application requests a missing dll under the path “C:\Users\currentuser\AppData\Local\Razer\RzAppEngine\User Data\Apps\SurroundSound\ncrypt.dll”
Move your malicious ncrypt.dll inside the abovementioned folder
Restart the client and the .dll should be axecuted accordingly.


Remediation
The optimal method for preventing DLL hijacking starts with software developers who can indicate the exact location of all DLL files to keep Windows from using the default DLL search path protocol.
